    text: Service Endpoints or Private Link are used for accessing Azure PaaS services.
    description: 'Service Endpoints and Private Link can be leveraged to restrict access to PaaS endpoints only from authorized virtual networks, effectively mitigating data intrusion risks and associated impact to application availability. Service Endpoints provide service level access to a PaaS service, while Private Link provides direct access to a specific PaaS resource to mitigate data exfiltration risks (e.g. malicious admin scenarios). Don’t forget that Private Link is a paid service and has meters for inbound and outbound data processed. Private Endpoints are charged as well.'

    text: Hub and spoke design pricing is understood.
    description: 'Virtual WAN has costs that are different in hub and spoke design. The cost of the peering network or other service routing has to be included. If Private Link is deployed, peering is not billed - only private link.'

    text: DDoS attack mitigation plans and capabilities are in place.
    description: 'DDoS attacks can be very debilitating and completely block access to your services or even take down the services, depending on the type of DDoS attack. Use Standard protection for critical workloads where outage would have business impact. Also consider CDN as another layer of protection.'

    text: 'Azure Front Door, Azure App Gateway or Web Application Firewall is used.'
    description: 'There are cost implications to using Front Door with Web Application Firewall enabled, but it can save costs compared to using a 3rd party solution. Front Door has a good latency, because it uses unicast. If only 1 or 2 regions are required, Application Gateway can be used. There are cost implications of having a WAF – you should check pricing of hours and GB/s.'

    text: The workload is connected between regions (using network peering or gateways).
    description: Data exchange between regions has cost implications. Peering within the same region is cheaper than peering between regions. Inbound and outbound traffic is charged at both ends of the peered networks.

    text: Public IPs and orphaned NICs are regularly cleaned up.
    description: There's a difference in billing for regular and static public IP addresses. There should be a process to look for orphan network interface cards (NICs) and PIPs that are not being used in production and non-production.
