    text: Application logs are collected from different application environments.
    description: Application logs support the end-to-end application life-cycle. Logging is essential in understanding how the application operates in various environments and what events occur and under which conditions.

    text: You monitor how much of an application is involved in serving a single request.
    description: 'When understanding load and demands on the application, it is necessary to understand how the application is architected - whether monolithic, n-Tier, or microservice-based - and then understand how load is distributed across the application. This is crucial for focusing on the testing of individual components and identifying bottlenecks.'

    text: 'You have determined an acceptable operational margin between your peak utilization and the application''s maximum load, and monitor for this.'
    description: 'What is the maximum taxation you wish to place on resources? Factors such as memory, CPU, and disk IOPS should all be considered. Once a stress test has been performed resulting in the maximum supported load and an operational margin has been chosen, it is best to determine an operational threshold. Then, environment scaling (automatic or manual) can be performed once the threshold has been reached.'

    text: You are aware of the appropriate metrics to monitor for performance tests under standard load.
    description: 'A true performance test measures how the application performs under a standard load. It is critical to understand how your application operates--including CPU utilization and memory consumption--under a standard load. First, this will help you plan accordingly as you anticipate future user growth. Second, this gives you a baseline for performance regression testing.'
