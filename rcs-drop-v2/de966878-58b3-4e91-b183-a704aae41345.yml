    context: 'Containers are most resilient when there is no need to store state within the container, or any state is delegated to a separate service such as Azure PaaS services. Ideally, use a service which supports multi-region replication for increased resilience. For example, configuration can be stored in Azure App Configuration, in-memory state such as session can be delegated instead to a distributed cache such as Azure Cache for Redis, and disk-based state can make use of Azure Blob or File Storage.'

It is important to use an automated approach to update your images to ensure they are using the most up to date versions of base images as possible. It is good practice to regularly update base images, ensure application runtimes are up to date and redeploy workloads when required. Using automation to monitor the update status of base images can improve the reliability of this process.'
