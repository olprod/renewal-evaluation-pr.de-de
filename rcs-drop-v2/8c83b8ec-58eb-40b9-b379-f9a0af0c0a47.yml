    text: You use primary and secondary IoT hubs and the devices are programmed to connect to the secondary hub in the event that the primary hub isn't available. Devices fail back when the primary hub is restored.
    description: The fastest failover can be achieved by maintaining two connection strings to the device and determining at the device level when to failover to the other IoT hub.
