    context: 'Row-Level Security enables you to use group membership or execution context to control access to rows in a database table. Row-Level Security (RLS) simplifies the design and coding of security in your application. RLS helps you implement restrictions on data row access. For example, you can ensure that workers access only those data rows that are pertinent to their department. Another example is to restrict customers'' data access to only the data relevant to their company. The access restriction logic is located in the database tier rather than away from the data in another application tier. The database system applies the access restrictions every time that data access is attempted from any tier. This makes your security system more reliable and robust by reducing the surface area of your security system.'

    context: The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is an industry standard designed to help protect the privacy of information communicated over the Internet. TLS 1.2 is a standard that provides security improvements over previous versions. TLS 1.2 will eventually be replaced by the newest released standard TLS 1.3 which is faster and has improved security. This article presents recommendations to secure .NET Framework applications that use the TLS protocol.
