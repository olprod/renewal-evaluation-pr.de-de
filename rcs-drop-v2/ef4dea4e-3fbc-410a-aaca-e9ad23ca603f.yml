    text: Use Azure Machine Learning pipeline step to process large amounts of data asynchronously and in parallel.
    description: Common use cases for pipelines are training a model or running offline inference to generate predictions on a batch of observations. ParallelRunStep works by breaking up your data into batches that are processed in parallel. The batch size node count and other tunable parameters to speed up your parallel processing can be controlled with the ParallelRunConfig class.
