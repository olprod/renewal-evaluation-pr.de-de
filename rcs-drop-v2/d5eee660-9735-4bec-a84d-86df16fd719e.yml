    text: There are tools and processes in place to grant just-in-time access.
    description: 'Minimizing the number of people who have access to secure information or resources reduces the chance of a malicious actor gaining access or an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource. For example, Azure AD Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that you care about.'

    text: Appropriate emergency access accounts are configured for this workload in case of an emergency.
    description: 'While rare, sometimes extreme circumstances arise where all normal means of administrative access are unavailable and for this reason emergency access accounts (also refered to as ''break glass'' accounts) should be available. These accounts are strictly controlled in accordance with best practice guidance, and they are closely monitored for unsanctioned use to ensure they are not compromised or used for nefarious purposes.'

Examples of such contact groups include network security, network management, server endpoint security, incident response, policy management, identity...'

    text: The application team has a clear view on responsibilities and individual/group access levels for this workload.
    description: 'Application roles and responsibility model need to be defined covering the different access level of each operational function (e.g publish production release, access customer data, manipulate database records). It''s in the interest of the application team to include central functions (e.g. SecOps, NetOps, IAM) into this view.'

    text: Workload infrastructure is protected with role-based access control (RBAC).
    description: 'Performing role-based or/or resource-based authorization with Azure Active Directory allows centralized management that supports principal of least privilege when accessing organizational resources. RBAC provides the necessary tools to maintain separation of concerns when it comes to accessing the application infrastructure. Aligned with the separation of duties section, users should have only the minimal set of permissions. Examples: "Developers can''t access production infrastructure.", "Only the SecOps team can read and manage Key Vault secrets.", "Project A team can access and manage Resource Group A and all resources within."'

    text: Resource locks are leveraged to protect critical infrastructure of this workload.
    description: 'Critical infrastructure typically doesn''t change often. To prevent accidental/undesired modification of resources, Azure offers the locking functionality where only specific roles and users with permissions are able to delete/modify resources. Locks can be used on critical parts of the infrastructure, but special care needs to be taken in the DevOps process - modification locks can sometimes block automation.'

    text: Permissions to Azure workloads are rarely based on individual resources and custom permissions are rarely used.
    description: Custom resource-based permissions are often not needed and can result in increased complexity and confusion as they do not carry the intention to new similar resources. This then accumulates into a complex legacy configuration that is difficult to maintain or change without fear of "breaking something" â€“ negatively impacting both security and solution agility. Higher level permissions sets - based on resource groups or management groups - are usually more efficient.

    text: There are processes and tools being used to manage privileged activities. Long standing administrative access is avoided whenever possible.
    description: Zero-trust principle comes with the requirement of no standing access to an environment. Native and 3rd party solution can be used to elevate access permissions for at least highly privileged if not all activities. Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (Azure AD PIM) is the recommended and Azure native solution.

    text: There is a lifecycle management policy for critical accounts in this workload and privileged accounts are reviewed regularly.
    description: A compromise of an account in a role that is assigned privileges with a business-critical impact can be detrimental to organizational information systems and should therefore be closely monitored including a lifecycle process. It is important to set up a recurring review pattern to ensure that accounts are removed from permissions as roles change.
