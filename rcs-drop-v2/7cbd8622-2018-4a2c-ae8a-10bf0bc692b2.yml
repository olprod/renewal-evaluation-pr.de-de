    text: We evaluated the properties which need to be indexed in our documents.
    description: |
      When using the SQL API, by default all properties will be indexed. Having unneeded indexes on all properties will unnecessarily increase the cost of write operations. You should understand the queries you are running to inform the choice of indexes included in your index policy.
