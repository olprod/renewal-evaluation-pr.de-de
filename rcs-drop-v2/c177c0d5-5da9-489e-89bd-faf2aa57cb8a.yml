  Cost modeling is an exercise where you create logical groups of cloud resources that are mapped to the organization's hierarchy and then estimate costs for those groups. The goal of cost modeling is to estimate the overall cost of the organization in the cloud.  For monitoring costs, consider the metrics for each resource in the workload. For each metric, build alerts on baseline thresholds.
