    text: Optimize read performance from JDBC data sources in Azure Databricks.
    description: 'In order to load data in parallel, the Spark JDBC data source must be configured with appropriate partitioning information so that it can issue multiple concurrent queries to the external database. If you neglect to configure partitioning, then all data will be fetched on the driver using a single JDBC query which runs the risk of causing the driver to throw an OOM exception.'

    text: Optimize performance with caching for AI workloads in Azure Databricks.
    description: 'The Delta cache accelerates data reads by creating copies of remote files in nodes` local storage using a fast intermediate data format. The data is cached automatically whenever a file has to be fetched from a remote location. Successive reads of the same data are then performed locally, which results in significantly improved reading speed.'

    text: Use Azure Databricks GPU clusters to optimize the running speed for model inference and data at scale.
    description: 'Using GPUs and other accelerators helps keeping up with the increasing data input pipeline. As data input pipeline reads the data into Spark Dataframes, transforms it, and loads it as the input for model inference, increaing I/O throughput will help to release such perfomance bottleneck.'
