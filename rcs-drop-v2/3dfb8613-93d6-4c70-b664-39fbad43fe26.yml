    text: Appropriate SKUs are used for workload servers.
    description: 'The performance required and infrastructure utilization are key factors which define the "size" of Azure resources to be used, but there can be hidden aspects that affect cost too. Watch for cost variations between different SKUs – for example App Service Plans S3 cost the same as P2v2, but have worse performance characteristics.'

    text: Appropriate operating systems are used in the workload.
    description: 'Analyze the technology stack and identify which workloads are capable of running on Linux and which require Windows. Linux-based VMs and App Services are significantly cheaper, but require the app to run on supported stack (.NET Core, Node.js etc.).'

    text: A recent review of SKUs that could benefit from Reserved Instances for 1 or 3 years or more has been performed.
    description: 'Purchasing reserved instances is a way to reduce Azure costs for workloads with stable usage. You have to manage utilization: if it’s too low then you are paying for resources that are not being used. One advice is to keep RI instances simple and not trying to have too much management overhead that has to be factored in as part of the cost.'

    text: Burstable (B) series VM sizes are used for VMs that are idle most of the time and have high usage only in certain periods.
    description: 'The B-series VMs are ideal for workloads that do not need the full performance of the CPU continuously, like web servers, proof of concepts, small databases and development build environments.'

    text: VM instances which are not used are shut down.
    description: Use the Start/Stop VMs during off-hours feature of virtual machines to minimize waste. There are many configuration options to schedule start the stop times. The feature is suitable as a low-cost automation option. Azure Advisor evaluates virtual machines based on CPU and network utilization over a time period and recommends actions like shut down or resize instances.

    text: Spot virtual machines are used.
    description: 'Spot VMs are ideal for workloads that can be interrupted, such as highly parallel batch processing jobs. These VMs take advantage of the surplus capacity in Azure at a lower cost. They''re also well suited for experimenting, development and testing of large-scale solutions.'

    text: PaaS is used as an alternative to buying virtual machines.
    description: 'When you use the Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) model, operational and maintenance costs are included in the pricing and in some cases can be cheaper than managing VMs on your own.'

    text: Costs are optimized by using the App Service Premium (v3) plan over the Premium (Pv2) plan.
    description: "The App Service Premium (v3) Plan has a 20% discount versus comparable Pv2 configurations. Reserved Instance commitment (1Y, 3Y, Dev/Test) discounts are available for App Services running in the Premium v3 plan. The Premium v3\_pricing tier provides faster processors, SSD storage, and quadruple the memory-to-core ratio of the existing pricing tiers (double the Premium v2 tier). With the performance advantage, you can save money by running your apps on fewer instances."
