    text: 'BCP [Business Continuity Planning] Tiers for SAP applications defined.'
    description: '[Business Continuity Planning] BCP Tier defines the RPO and RTO for business. A Tier1 is highest availability and highest recover-ability category. The key definition for a system to fall into this environment is that it requires near-zero or real-time replication of data and automated failover to the secondary node within the chosen region. If the data is replicated, but the recovery requires manual intervention you are immediately pushed into Tier 2.  '
