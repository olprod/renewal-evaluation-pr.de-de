    text: Defined a disaster recovery strategy to capture recovery steps for failover and failback.
    description: 'A disaster recovery strategy should capture how the application responds to a disaster situation such as a regional outage or the loss of a critical platform service, using either a re-deployment, warm-spare active-passive, or hot-spare active-active approach. To drive cost down consider splitting application components and data into groups. For example: 1) must protect, 2) nice to protect, 3) ephemeral/can be rebuilt/lost, instead of protecting all data with the same policy.'
