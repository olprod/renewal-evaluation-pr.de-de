    text: Recovery targets have been defined for how long workload can be unavailable (Recovery Time Objective) and how much data is acceptable to lose (Recovery Point Objective) in the event of an unplanned outage or disaster.
    description: Have RPO/RTO targets been defined for the application and key scenarios? Recovery time objective (RTO) - the maximum acceptable time an application is unavailable after an incident. Recovery point objective (RPO) - the maximum duration of data loss that is acceptable during a disaster.
