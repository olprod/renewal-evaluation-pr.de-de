    text: Messages use a binary message protocol to limit the message size.
    description: 'Messages use a binary message protocol to limit the message size. An Azure IoT Hub message consists of system properties, application properties, and an opaque binary payload. The encoding of the payload can be any form: JSON, text, or binary. Binary payloads reduce the message size.'
