    text: Azure Service Health alerts been created to respond to Service-level events.
    description: 'Azure Service Health Alerts should be configured to operationalize Service Health events. However, Service Health alerts should not be used to detect issues due to associated latencies; there is a 5 minute Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for automated issues, but many issues require manual interpretation to define an RCA (Root Cause Analysis). Instead, they should be used to provide extremely useful information to help interpret issues that have already been detected and surfaced via the health model, to inform how best to operationally respond.'

    text: Azure Resource Health alerts been created to respond to Resource-level events.
    description: 'Azure Resource Health Alerts should be configured for specific resource groups and resource types, and should be adjusted to maximize signal to noise ratios, i.e. only distribute a notification when a resource becomes unhealthy according to the application health model or due to an Azure platform-initiated event. It is therefore important to consider transient issues when setting an appropriate threshold for resource unavailability, such as configuring an alert for a virtual machine with a threshold of 1 minute for unavailability before an alert is triggered.'
