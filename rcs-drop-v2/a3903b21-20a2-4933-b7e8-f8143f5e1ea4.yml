  Identity is an important aspect of any multitenant solution. The identity components of your application are responsible for both of the following:

  --  Verifying who a user is (authentication).

  --  Enforcing the user's permissions within the scope of a tenant (authorization).

  Your customers might also wish to authorize external applications to access their data or to integrate to your solution. A user's identity determines what information a user or service will get access to. It's important that you consider your identity requirements, in order to isolate your application and data between tenants.
