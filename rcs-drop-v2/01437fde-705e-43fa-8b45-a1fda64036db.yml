    text: 'Using datastores and datasets mounts allows for reusability throughout workload. '
    description: 'Mounting a dataset on a remote compute prevents the data from being moved, copied, or duplicated. Dataset mounts allow for registration of the data connection to reduce hard coding connection strings and to enable reusability throughout workload. Because the data remains in its existing location, the performance of the solution improves. '

    text: Use advanced automated ML options to increase performance/ROI on experiment run time.
    description: 'Automated ML options, such as excluding specific models, improve experiment performance. When using the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK, use the option blocked_models in your AutoMLConfig object and list the model(s) you don''t want to use. Using the automated ML interface, go to blocked algorithm and select algorithms you want to exclude from the training job.'
