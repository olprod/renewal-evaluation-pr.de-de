    text: You have identified goals or a baseline for workload performance.
    description: 'There are many types of goals when determining baselines for application performance. Perhaps baselines center around a certain number of visitors within a given time period, the time it takes to render a page, type required for executing a stored procedure, or a desired number of transactions if your site conducts some type of e-commerce. It is important to identify and maintain a shared understanding of these baselines so that you can architect a system that meets them.'

    text: Performance goals are based on device and/or connectivity type as appropriate.
    description: 'It is important to identify how users are connecting to your application. Are they primarily connecting via a wired connection, wireless, or by using a mobile device? Additionally, you should seek to understand the targeted device types, whether that a mobile device, a tablet or laptop/desktop PC.'

    text: You have defined an initial connection goal for your workload.
    description: 'It would be helpful to determine a goal that is based upon from when the connection reaches the server, to when the service spins/cycles up, to providing a response. By establishing this baseline, you and your customer can determine if adequate resources have been assigned to the machine. These resources can included, but are not limited to processors, RAM, and disk IOPS. Finally, creating rules for ''Always-On'' or properly configuring idle time-outs (e.g. IIS, containers, etc.) will be especially helpful for optimizing response times.'

    text: There is a goal defined for complete page load times.
    description: 'What are your goals for a completed page load? When formulating this metric, it is important to note the varying thresholds that can be deemed acceptable. Some companies, whose primary audience is internal and are salary-based, may base their thresholds on the user''s mental capacity to sit at the application screen. Other customers that have service-related users (i.e. users who are paid for performance) may base their thresholds on the ability to keep the user working as fast as possible (mental state is not the primary motivator) because increased productivity typically increases revenue.'

    text: You have defined goals for an API (service) endpoint complete response.
    description: 'Data-centric applications are comprised of pulling data from various API endpoints. For a single page, this could mean many server requests. The page is only as fast as the slowest endpoint. It is important for you to test the performance of your APIs to quickly identify bottlenecks in the application that impede user experience.'

    text: There are goals defined for server response time.
    description: 'Similar to previous questions regarding the initial connection to a service, you will also want to understand how long it takes for the server to receive, process, and then return data. This round-trip can also help ensure that enough hardware resources have been assigned to the environment. Additionally, it is possible to identify ''noisy neighbors'', applications running on the same disk (typically in a virtualized environment) or sharing the same network, that are consuming available resources.'

    text: You have goals for latency between the systems & microservices of your workload.
    description: 'Performance should not only be monitored within the application itself, but response times between service tiers should also be noted. While this is important for n-Tier applications, it is especially crucial for microservices. Most microservices leverage some type of pub-sub architecture where communication is asynchronous. However, validation for sending and receiving messages should still take place. In these instances, understanding the routing and latency between services is imperative to improving performance.'

    text: There are goals on database query efficiency.
    description: 'Ensuring the data operations are optimized is a key component to any performance assessment. It is important to understand what data is being queried and when. The data life-cycle, if abused, can adversely affect the performance of any application (or microservice). Confirm that a database administrator (a data architect is preferred) is part of the assessment as they will have the necessary tools for monitoring and optimizing a database and its queries.'

    text: You have a methodology to determine what acceptable performance is.
    description: 'There is almost no limit to how much an application can be performance-tuned. How do you know when you have tuned an application enough? It really comes down to the 80/20 rule--generally, 80% of the application can be optimized by focusing on just 20%. While you can continue optimizing certain elements of the application, after optimizing the initial 20%, a company typically sees a diminishing return on any further optimization.'
