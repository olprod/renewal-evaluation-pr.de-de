    text: Reserved capacity reviewed and used for Azure Managed Disk used by the SAP workload where appropriate.
    description: |-
      Currently, Azure Disk Storage reservations are available only for select Azure premium SSD SKUs. The SKU of a premium SSD determines the disk's size and performance.
      When determining your storage needs, don't think of disks based on just capacity. For example, you can't have a reservation for a P40 disk and use that to pay for two smaller P30 disks. When purchasing a reservation, you're only purchasing a reservation for the total number of disks per SKU.

      A disk reservation is made per disk SKU. As a result, the reservation consumption is based on the unit of the disk SKUs instead of the provided size.

    text: Life-cycle policy is used to move data between access tiers.
    description: 'Life-cycle management policy periodically moves data between tiers. Policies can move data based on rules that specified by the user. For example, you might create rules that move blobs to the archive tier if that blob has not been modified in 90 days. Unused data can be also completely removed using a policy. By creating policies that adjust the access tier of your data, you can design the least expensive storage options for your need.'

    text: Shared disks are leveraged for suitable SAP workloads.
    description: 'You can leverage shared disks to enable cost-effective clustering instead of setting up own shared disks via S2D (Storage Spaces Direct). Sample workloads that would benefit from shared disks are: SAP ASCS/SCS on Windows.'

    text: 'For SAP database workloads, data and log files are stored on separate disks.'
    description: 'You can optimize IaaS DB workload performance by configuring system, data and log files to be on different disk SKUs (leveraging Premium Disks for data and Ultra Disks for logs satisfies most production scenarios). Furthermore, Ultra Disk cost/performance can by optimized by taking advantage of the ability to configure capacity, IOPS and throughput independently; and ability to dynamically configure these attributes. Example workloads are SQL on IaaS, Cassandra DB, Maria DB, MySQL and MongoDB on IaaS.'
