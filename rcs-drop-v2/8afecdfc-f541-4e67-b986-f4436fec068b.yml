      Azure offers a variety of data storage solutions including files, disks, blobs, and tables. Some Azure Storage data encryption at rest occurs by default with optional customer configuration.
      Server-side encryption (SSE) for SAP on Azure VMs protects your data and helps you meet organizational security and compliance commitments. SSE automatically encrypts data at rest on Azure-managed OS and data disks when persisting data to the cloud.

    description: |-
      Data is in transit or in flight when it moves from one location to another, whether internally on-premises or within Azure, or externally, like across the internet to the end user. Azure offers several mechanisms to keep data private in transit. All the mechanisms can use protection methods like encryption. These mechanisms include:

      Communication through virtual private networks (VPNs), using IPsec/IKE encryption Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or later via Azure components like Azure Application Gateway or Azure Front Door Protocols available on the Azure VMs, like Windows IPsec or SMB
