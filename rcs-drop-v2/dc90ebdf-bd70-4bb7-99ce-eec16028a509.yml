    text: You know how to handle high CPU or memory situations.
    description: 'If the application has very high CPU or memory utilization, then consider scaling the application either horizontal or vertical. Scaling horizontal to more compute resources will spread the load across more machines. This will, however, increase the network complexity as there will be more machines to support the system. Scaling the application vertical to a larger machine this is optimized for higher CPU or memory workloads may also be considered. Profiling the application code can be useful to find code structures that may be sub-optimal and replace them with better-optimized code. These decisions are a balance of several factors that can include cost, system complexity, and time to implement.'

    text: You know what to do when the application response times increase while not using all the CPU or memory allocated to the system.
    description: 'When the system response times increase without any increase in the CPU or memory, this is an indicator that there is a resource that is time-blocked. This can mean many things such as thread sleep, connection wait, message queueing, etc. The list can go on. The bottom line is there is something that is consuming time but not compute resources.'

    text: You use profiling tools to profile your application code.
    description: 'Application profiling will involve tooling like Visual Studio Performance Profile, AQTime, dotTrace, and others. These tools will give you in-depth analysis of individual code paths.'

    text: You have a response plan for network performance problems that includes traffic capturing tools.
    description: Network capture tooling can capture the network traffic and dive deeper into the interactions at the network layer that may affect your application due to network configuration and/or other network traffic issues.
