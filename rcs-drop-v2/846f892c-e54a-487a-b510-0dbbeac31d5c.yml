  Tabs are Microsoft Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. They can be added as part of a channel or a group chat inside a team or as a personal app for an individual user. As part of your app, you can add custom tabs to embed your own web content in Teams. Two types of tabs are available in Teams, channel/group and personal.
