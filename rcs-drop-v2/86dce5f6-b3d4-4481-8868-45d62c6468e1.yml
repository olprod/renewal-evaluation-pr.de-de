    text: 'You have a dedicated and secured store such as Azure SQL, Cosmos DB, or Azure Key Vault to store leaf and/or gateway device configuration data'
    description: 'Storing configuration data, such as secrets or settings, in a secure store enables you to more efficiently track version changes and automate deployments/updates. For example, when using Azure Key Vault to store configuration secrets, you can inject secrets directly from Key Vault into an Azure DevOps pipeline while executing a configuration or firmware update.'
