        description: 'Monitor underlying services. Synchronize your cloud identity with your existing identity systems. Consistency of identities across cloud and on-premises will reduce human errors and resulting security risk. Teams managing resources in both environment need a consistent authoritative source to achieve security assurances. For Azure, synchronize Azure AD with your existing authoritative on premises Active Directory using Azure AD connect. This is also required for an Office 365 migration, so it is often already done before Azure migration and development projects begin.'
