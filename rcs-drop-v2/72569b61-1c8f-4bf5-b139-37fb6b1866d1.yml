    text: You have a static number of downstream devices and messages per site that use MQTT/AMQP.
    description: 'When the number of downstream devices, their messages, and message size is static, and the devices use MQTT or AMQP to connect to the gateway/Azure IoT Edge, a single device in transparent mode can connect the downstream devices and forward the messages. The gateway/Azure IoT Edge device takes care of bidirectional communication and message buffering.'

    text: You have a static number of downstream devices and messages per site that use different or custom protocols.
    description: 'When the number of downstream devices, their messages and message size is static, and the protocol or message needs translation, a single gateway/Azure IoT Edge device in translation mode can connect the downstream devices and forward the messages. Account for bidirectional translation and message translation and message buffering overhead.'

    text: You have an increasing or dynamic number of downstream devices and messages per site that use MQTT/AMQP.
    description: 'With the capability to have multiple gateways/Azure IoT Edge devices per site and downstream devices that can connect to any of those devices, the solution is horizontally scalable. Gateways/Azure IoT Edge devices in transparent mode can connect MQTT/AMQP devices for bidirectional communication.'

    description: 'With the capability to have multiple gateways/Azure IoT Edge devices per site and downstream devices that can connect to any of those devices, the solution is horizontally scalable. Gateways/Azure IoT Edge devices in translation mode can translate protocols or message to and from downstream devices. However, a mapping is needed to find the gateway a downstream device is connected to. Account for additional message translation and buffering overhead at the gateway/Azure IoT Edge device.'
