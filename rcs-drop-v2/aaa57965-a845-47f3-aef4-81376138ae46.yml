This allows subsequent query executions to get results directly from the persisted cache so recomputation is not needed. Result set caching improves query performance and reduces compute resource usage. In addition, queries using cached results set do not use any concurrency slots and thus do not count against existing concurrency limits.'

A hash distributed table is designed to achieve high performance for queries on large tables. A replicated table has a full copy of the table available on every Compute node. Queries run fast on replicated tables because joins on replicated tables don''t require data movement. A round-robin table distributes table rows evenly across all distributions. The rows are distributed randomly. Loading data into a round-robin table is fast. But, queries can require more data movement than the other distribution methods.'

Thanks to built-in query execution fault-tolerance, the system provides high reliability and success rates even for long-running queries involving large data sets. If you need to explore data in the data lake, gain insights from it or optimize your existing data transformation pipeline, you can benefit from using serverless SQL pool. It is suitable for the following scenarios: Basic discovery and exploration - Quickly reason about the data in various formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON) in your data lake. Logical data warehouse – Provide a relational abstraction on top of raw or disparate data without relocating and transforming data, allowing always up-to-date view of your data. Data transformation - Simple, scalable, and performant way to transform data in the lake using T-SQL, so it can be fed to BI and other tools, or loaded into a relational data store (Synapse SQL databases, Azure SQL Database, etc.).'
