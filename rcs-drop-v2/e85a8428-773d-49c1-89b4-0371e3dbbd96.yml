    description: 'In the cloud, you should acknowledge up front that failures will happen. Instead of trying to prevent failures altogether, the goal is to minimize the effects of a single failing component. Testing is one way to minimize these effects. Automate testing your applications where possible, but you need to be prepared for when they fail. When a failure happens, having backup and recovery strategies becomes important.'
