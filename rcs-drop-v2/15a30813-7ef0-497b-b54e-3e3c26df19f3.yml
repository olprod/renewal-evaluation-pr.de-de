    text: 'Services used by this workload, which should not be accessible from public IP addresses, are protected with network restrictions / IP firewall rules.'
    description: Azure provides networking solutions to restrict access to individual application services. Multiple levels (such as IP filtering or firewall rules) should be explored to prevent application services from being accessed by unauthorized actors.

    text: Service Endpoints or Private Links are used for accessing Azure PaaS services.
    description: 'Service Endpoints and Private Link can be leveraged to restrict access to PaaS endpoints only from authorized virtual networks, effectively mitigating data intrusion risks and associated impact to application availability. Service Endpoints provide service level access to a PaaS service, while Private Link provides direct access to a specific PaaS resource to mitigate data exfiltration risks (e.g. malicious admin scenarios). Donâ€™t forget that Private Link is a paid service and has meters for inbound and outbound data processed. Private Endpoints are charged as well.'

    text: Azure Firewall or any 3rd party next generation firewall is used for this workload to control outgoing traffic of Azure PaaS services (data exfiltration protection) where Private Link is not available.
    description: NVA solutions and Azure Firewall (for supported protocols) can be leveraged as a reverse proxy to restrict access to only authorized PaaS services for services where Private Link is not yet supported (Azure Firewall).

    text: NSG flow logs are configured to get insights about incoming and outgoing traffic of this workload.
    description: NSG flow logs should be captured and analyzed to monitor performance and security. The NSG flow logs enables Traffic Analytics to gain insights into internal and external traffic flows of the application.

    text: 'Access to the workload backend infrastructure (APIs, databases, etc.) is restricted to only a minimal set of public IP addresses - only those who really need it.'
    description: Web applications typically have one public entrypoint and don't expose subsequent APIs and database servers over the internet. When using gateway services like Azure Front Door it's possible to restrict access only to a set of Front Door IP addresses and lock down the infrastructure completely.

    text: 'All public endpoints of this workload are protected/secured with appropriate solution (i.e. Azure Front Door, Azure Firewall...).'
    description: 'External application endpoints should be protected against common attack vectors, such as Denial of Service (DoS) attacks like Slowloris, to prevent potential application downtime due to malicious intent. Azure-native technologies such as Azure Firewall, Application Gateway/Azure Front Door WAF, and DDoS Protection Standard Plan can be used to achieve requisite protection (Azure DDoS Protection).'

    text: 'Workload virtual machines running on premises or in the cloud don''t have direct internet connectivity for users that may perform interactive logins, or by applications running on virtual machines.'
    description: Attackers constantly scan public cloud IP ranges for open management ports and attempt "easy" attacks like common passwords and known unpatched vulnerabilities. Limiting internet access from within an application server can prevent data exfiltration or stop the attacker from downloading additional tools.
