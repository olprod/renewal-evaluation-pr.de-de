    text: Recovery targets to identify how long the workload can be unavailable (Recovery Time Objective) and how much data is acceptable to lose during a disaster (Recovery Point Objective).
    description: Have RPO/RTO targets been defined for the application and key scenarios? Recovery time objective (RTO) - the maximum acceptable time an application is unavailable after an incident. Recovery point objective (RPO) - the maximum duration of data loss that is acceptable during a disaster.
