    text: Tools like Microsoft Defender for Cloud are used to discover and remediate common risks within Azure tenants.
    description: 'Identifying and remediating common security hygiene risks significantly reduces overall risk to the organization by increasing cost to attackers. Secure Score in Microsoft Defender for Cloud monitors the security posture of machines, networks, storage and data services, and applications to discover potential security issues (internet connected VMs, or missing security updates, missing endpoint protection or encryption, deviations from baseline security configurations, missing Web Application Firewall (WAF), and more).'

    text: The security team has read-only access into all cloud environment resources for this workload.
    description: 'Provide security teams read-only access to the security aspects of all technical resources in their purview. Security organizations require visibility into the technical environment to perform their duties of assessing and reporting on organizational risk. Without this visibility, security will have to rely on information provided from groups, operating the environment, who have a potential conflict of interest (and other priorities). Note that security teams may separately be granted additional privileges if they have operational responsibilities or a requirement to enforce compliance on Azure resources. For example in Azure, assign security teams to the Security Readers permission that provides access to measure security risk (without providing access to the data itself). Because security will have broad access to the environment (and visibility into potentially exploitable vulnerabilities), you should consider them critical impact accounts and apply the same protections as administrators.'

    text: Identity related risk events related to potentially compromised identities are actively monitored.
    description: 'Most security incidents take place after an attacker initially gains access using a stolen identity. These identities can often start with low privileges, but attackers then use that identity to traverse laterally and gain access to more privileged identities. This repeats as needed until the attacker controls access to the ultimate target data or systems. Reported risk events for Azure AD can be viewed in Azure AD reporting, or Azure AD Identity Protection. Additionally, the Identity Protection risk events API can be used to programmatically access identity related security detections using Microsoft Graph.'

    text: Periodic & automated access reviews of the workload are conducted to ensure that only authorized people have access?
    description: 'As people in the organization and on the project change, it is crucial to make sure that only the right people have access to the application infrastructure. Auditing and reviewing the access control reduces the attack vector to the application. Azure control plane depends on Azure AD and access reviews are often centrally performed often as part of internal or external audit activities. For the application specific access it is recommended to do the same at least twice a year.'
