    text: We have evaluated the three different traffic routing methods.
    description: 'Azure Traffic Manager supports three traffic-routing methods to determine how to route network traffic to the various service endpoints. Traffic Manager applies the traffic-routing method to each DNS query it receives. The traffic-routing method determines which endpoint is returned in the DNS response. The customer should be aware of these, and the differences in routing between endpoints.'

    text: We have considered nested Traffic Manager profiles.
    description: 'Each Traffic Manager profile specifies a single traffic-routing method. However, there are scenarios that require more sophisticated traffic routing than the routing provided by a single Traffic Manager profile. You can nest Traffic Manager profiles to combine the benefits of more than one traffic-routing method. Nested profiles allow you to override the default Traffic Manager behavior to support larger and more complex application deployments.'
