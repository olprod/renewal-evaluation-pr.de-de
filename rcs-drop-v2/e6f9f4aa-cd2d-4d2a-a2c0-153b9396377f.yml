    text: You know the growth rate of your data.
    description: 'Your solution might work great in the first week or month, but what happens when data just keeps increasing? Will the solution slow down, or will it even break at a particular threshold? Planning for data growth, data retention, and archiving is essential in capacity planning. Without adequately planning capacity for your datastores, performance will be negatively affected.'
