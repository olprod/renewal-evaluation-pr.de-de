    text: 'You''ve defined the list of users and security principals with access to Azure IoT Hub, DPS, and any other backend service along with their corresponding permissions using Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and IAM features.'
    description: 'You can use Azure Active Directory to authenticate requests to Azure IoT Hub service APIs, such as create device identity and invoke direct method. You can also use Azure RBAC to authorize those same service APIs. By using these technologies together, you can grant permissions to access Azure IoT Hub service APIs to an Azure Active Directory security principal. This security principal could be a user, group, or application service principal.'
