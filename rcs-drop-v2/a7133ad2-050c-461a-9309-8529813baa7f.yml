stem: 'You should have a centralized registry for your organization''s IoT devices to manage their lifecycle and audit device access. Use a cloud-based identity registry to handle the scale, management, and security of IoT solutions. IoT device registry information is used to onboard devices into an IoT solution by verifying that the device identity and credentials are known and authorized to onboard to the organization. Once onboarded, the device registry contains the core properties of devices, including its operational identity and the credentials it uses to authenticate for everyday use. In cases where devices don''t connect to Azure services for IoT, you can use network sensors to detect and inventory unmanaged IoT devices in your organization''s network for awareness and monitoring.'
