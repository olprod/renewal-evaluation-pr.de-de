  Perform testing as part of each major change and, if possible, on a regular basis to validate existing thresholds, targets, and assumptions, as well as ensuring the validity of the health model, capacity model, and operational procedures. 
  In IoT solutions there are two components, first the devices that run software to obtain and send telemetry and second the way the data is received and processed in the cloud.
