stem: 'One of the benefits of cloud technology is continuous improvement and evolution. As a service provider, you need to apply updates to your solution: you might need to make changes to your Azure infrastructure, your code/applications, your database schemas, or any other component. It''s important to plan how you update your environments. In a multitenant solution, it''s particularly important to be clear about your update policy, since some of your tenants may be reluctant to allow changes to their environments, or they might have requirements that limit the times when you can update their service. You need to identify your tenants'' requirements, clarify your own requirements to operate your service, find a balance that works for everyone, and then communicate this clearly.'
