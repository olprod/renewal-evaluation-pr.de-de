    text: We have evaluated continuous backup in Azure Cosmos DB for more granular point-in-time restore and self-serve capabilities.
    description: |-
      Continuous backups ensure the backup is taken in each region every 100 seconds and provide the ability to restore data to any desired point in time with second granularity.

      Periodic backups take full backups of all partitions from all containers under your account, with no synchronization across partitions. The minimum backup interval is one hour.

    text: We have configured our Azure Cosmos DB workload based on the availability requirements and understand the SLA impact.
    description: |-
      If a solution requires continuous availability during region outages, Azure Cosmos DB can be configured to replicate your data across multiple regions and to transparently fail over to available regions when required.

      Single-region accounts may lose availability following a regional outage. To ensure high availability at all times, it's recommended to set up your Cosmos DB account with a single write region and at least a second (read) region and enable service-managed failover.
