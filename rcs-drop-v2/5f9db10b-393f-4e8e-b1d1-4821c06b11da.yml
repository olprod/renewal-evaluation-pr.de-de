    text: There is a capacity model for the workload
    description: 'A capacity model should describe the relationships between the utilization of various components as a ratio, to capture when and how application components should scale-out. For instance, scaling the number of Application Gateway v2 instances may put excess pressure on downstream components unless also scaled to a degree. When modelling capacity for critical system components it is therefore recommended that an N+1 model be applied to ensure complete tolerance to transient faults, where N describes the capacity required to satisfy performance and availability requirements. This also prevents cost-related surprises when scaling out and realizing that multiple services need to be scaled at the same time.'
