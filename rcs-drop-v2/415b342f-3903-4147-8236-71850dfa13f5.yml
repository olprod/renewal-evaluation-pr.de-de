    text: You are using a Content Delivery Network.
    description: CDNs store static files in locations that are typically geographically closer to the user than the data center. This increases overall application performance as latency for delivery and downloading these artifacts is reduced.

    text: You are offloading SSL.
    description: 'SSL offloading places the SSL certificate at an appliance that sits in front of the web server, instead of on the web server itself. This is beneficial for two reasons. First, the verification of the SSL certificate is conducted by the appliance instead of the web server, which reduces the taxation on the server. Second, SSL offloading increases operational efficiency as it can often eliminate the need to manage certificates across microservices.'

    text: You are using authentication/token verification offloading.
    description: 'Like SSL offloading, authentication/token verification offloading on an appliance can reduce taxation on the server. Additionally, authentication verification offloading can greatly reduce development complication as developers no longer need to worry with the complications of SAML or OAuth tokens and, instead, can focus specifically on the business logic.'

    text: 'You have defined, tested, and validated latency targets for key scenarios.'
    description: 'Latency targets, which are commonly defined as first byte in to last byte out, should be defined and measured for key application scenarios, as well as each individual component, to validate overall application performance and health.'

    text: 'You have defined, tested, and validated throughput targets for key scenarios.'
    description: 'Throughput targets, which are commonly defined in terms of IOPS, MB/s and Block Size, should be defined and measured for key application scenarios, as well as each individual component, to validate overall application performance and health. Available throughput typically varies based on SKU, so defined targets should be used to inform the use of appropriate SKUs.'

    text: You have identified all components that are sensitive to network latency.
    description: Components or scenarios that are sensitive to network latency may indicate a need for co-locality within a single Availability Zone or even closer using Proximity Placement Groups with Accelerated Networking enabled.
