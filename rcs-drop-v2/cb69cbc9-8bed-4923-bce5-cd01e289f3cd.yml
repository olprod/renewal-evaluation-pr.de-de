    text: The workload can scale horizontally in response to changing load.
    description: A scale-unit approach should be taken to ensure that each application component and the application as a whole can scale effectively in response to changing demand. A robust capacity model should be used to define when and how the application should scale.

    text: Configured scaling policies to use the appropriate metrics.
    description: By performing load testing you can evaluate the bottlenecks in your workload and then configure your autoscaling rules to trigger off of the metrics related to those bottlenecks.

    text: Automatically schedule autoscaling to add resources based on time of day trends.
    description: Preemptively scaling based on historical data can ensure your application is performant before your metrics indicate additional resources are required.

    text: Autoscaling has been tested under sustained load.
    description: The scaling on any single component may have an impact on downstream application components and dependencies. Autoscaling should therefore be tested regularly to help inform and validate a capacity model describing when and how application components should scale.

    text: You have measured the time it takes to scale in and out.
    description: 'Time to scale-in and scale-out can vary between Azure services and instance sizes and should be assessed to determine if a certain amount of pre-scaling is required to handle scale requirements and expected traffic patterns, such as seasonal load variations.'
