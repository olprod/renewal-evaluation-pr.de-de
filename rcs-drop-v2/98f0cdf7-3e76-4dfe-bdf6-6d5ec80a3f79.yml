stem: 'You can combine different elements to determine the health of a device that''s used by a risk assessment system for runtime decisions. Some of these elements can be captured through a system such as attestation - such a system uses a combination of hardware and cryptography to ensure that the measurements are tamper resistant. However, you must also rely on signals that aren''t attested. According to the industry standards, the evaluation of the device health should include assessments around: security configuration ("Is the device configured securely?"), vulnerability ("Is the device running software that is out of date, or software that has known vulnerabilities?"), insecure credential ("Is the device using secure credentials such as certificates and protocols such as TLS 1.2+?"), active threats and threat alerts, and anomalous behavioral alerts such as network patterns and usage deviation).'
