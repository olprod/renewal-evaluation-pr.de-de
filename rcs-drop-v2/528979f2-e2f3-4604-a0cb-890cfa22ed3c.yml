    text: You have defined and implemented a testing process for failover and failback of both IoT resources and other backend services in your solution.
    description: You can use a manual failover on a non-production Azure IoT Hub for testing and learning how the process works.

    text: You've tested and validated the failover and failback process at least once.
    description: 'You can perform a planned failover to test your disaster recovery capabilities. Ideally, you should use a test IoT hub rather than one running in production.'

    text: You use the health model to classify failover situations.
    description: All application resources should be configured to route diagnostic logs and metrics to the chosen log aggregation technology. Application-level events should be automatically correlated with resource level metrics to quantify the current application state.

    text: The solution has appropriate retry policies in place for intra-region high availability.
    description: The Azure IoT Hub service provides intra-region HA by implementing redundancies in almost all layers of the service. Build appropriate retry policies into the components interacting with a cloud application to deal with transient failures.

    text: You've documented the recovery steps to recover both from a Microsoft-initiated failover and from a manual failover.
    description: 'Whether Microsoft initiated a failover or it was a manual failover, you should document the steps to bring the end-to-end solution back online.'

stem: 'The steps required to recover or failover the application to a secondary Azure region in failure situations should be codified, preferably in an automated manner, to ensure capabilities exist to effectively respond to an outage in a way that limits impact. Similar codified steps should also exist to capture the process required to failback the application to the primary region once a failover triggering issue has been addressed.'
