stem: 'The steps required to recover or fail over the application to a secondary Azure region in failure situations should be codified, preferably in an automated manner, to ensure capabilities exist to effectively respond to an outage in a way that limits impact. Similar codified steps should also exist to capture the process required to failback the application to the primary region once a failover triggering issue has been addressed.'
