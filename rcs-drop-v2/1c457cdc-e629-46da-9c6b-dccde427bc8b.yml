    text: You understand how to optimize keep-alive messages sent from a device to IoT Hub.
    description: Keep alive/heartbeat messages are essential for checking device status but are a burden if they're a part of a message. Azure IoT checks keep-alive not in a message and has no charge.

    text: Understand how to reduce number of messages for device status through event handling instead of sending regular message inside devices.
    description: 'Events generate a number of messages form devices, including device status. It''s helpful to reduce costs if you check device status and its sensors inside devices and send events only when the device has a problem.'
