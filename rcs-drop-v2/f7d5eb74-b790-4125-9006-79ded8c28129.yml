    text: Landing Zone concept is implemented for this workload using Azure Blueprints and/or Azure Policies.
    description: 'Landing Zone refers to components that are already defined and in place before the workloads are getting deployed by the workload owners, e.g. network topology with Hub/Spoke concept. The purpose of the "Landing Zone" is to ensure that when a workload lands on Azure, the required "plumbing" is already in place, providing greater agility and compliance with enterprise security and governance requirements. It is crucial that a Landing Zone will be handed over to the workload owner with the security guardrails deployed.'
