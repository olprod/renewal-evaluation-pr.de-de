    context: The Standard Tier of Azure Service Bus only supports the implementation of sender and receiver side geo-redundancy. An outage or disaster in an Azure Region could cause downtime in your solution.

      scoreOf: []
    context: 'The Service Bus Premium Tier supports Availability Zones to provide zone redundancy within an Azure Region. This means that there will be three copies of the messaging store, with one allocated as the primary and the others as secondaries. If the primary zone becomes unavailable, a secondary is automatically promoted to primary with no perceivable downtime. NOTE: Availability Zones are available in a subset of Azure Regions with new regions being added regularly.'

      scoreOf: []
    context: 'Azure Service Bus uses a message broker to handle messages that are sent to a Queue or Topic. By default, all messages are handled by the same message broker process which can limit the overall throughput of the messaging entity. However, you can also partition a queue or topic when it is created.'

      scoreOf: []
    context: It is recommended that AMQP be the preferred protocol due to its efficiency. Connections to the Service Bus are maintained and batching and prefetching are implemented. It is also an international standard (ISO/IEC 19494) with cross-platform compatibility. NetMessaging/SBMP is being phased out in favour of AMQP.
