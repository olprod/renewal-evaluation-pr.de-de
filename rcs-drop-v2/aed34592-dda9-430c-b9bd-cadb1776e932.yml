    text: Error budgets used to track service reliability.
    description: 'An error budget describes the maximum amount of time that the application can fail without consequence, and is typically calculated as 1-Service Level Agreement (SLA). For example, if the SLA specifies that the application will function 99.99% of the time before the business has to compensate customers, the error budget is 52 minutes and 35 seconds per year.'

    text: There is a policy that governs what happens when the error budget is exhausted.
    description: 'If the application error budget has been met or exceeded and the application is operating at or below the defined Service Level Agreement (SLA), a policy may stipulate that all deployments are frozen until they reduce the number of errors to a level that allows deployments to proceed.'

    description: 'Throughput targets, which are commonly defined in terms of IOPS, MB/s and Block Size, should be defined and measured for key application scenarios, as well as each individual component, to validate overall application performance and health. Available throughput typically varies based on SKU, so defined targets should be used to inform the use of appropriate SKUs.'

    text: Defined a disaster recovery strategy to capture recovery steps for failover and failback.
    description: 'A disaster recovery strategy should capture how the application responds to a disaster situation such as a regional outage or the loss of a critical platform service, using either a re-deployment, warm-spare active-passive, or hot-spare active-active approach. To drive cost down consider splitting application components and data into groups. For example: 1) must protect, 2) nice to protect, 3) ephemeral/can be rebuilt/lost, instead of protecting all data with the same policy.'
