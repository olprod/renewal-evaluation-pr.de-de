We have global connectivity between VNets in these Azure regions and between multiple on-premises locations through the Azure Global Network. - Our organization intends to integrate a large-scale branch network that requires more than 100 branch sites for native IPsec termination directly into Azure using a software-defined WAN (SD-WAN) deployment. - Our organization requires transitive routing between VPN and ExpressRoute. Remote branches linked via site-to-site VPN and/or remote users linked via point-to-site VPN connect to on-premises datacenters via Azure using the ExpressRoute private infrastructure. - Our organization needs an aggregated throughput higher than 10 Gbps between Azure and on-premises locations.'

stem: The hub is a virtual network in Azure that acts as a central point of connectivity to your on-premises network. The spokes are virtual networks that peer with the hub and can be used to isolate workloads. Traffic flows between the on-premises data center(s) and the hub through an ExpressRoute or VPN gateway connection. The main differentiator of this approach is the use of Azure Virtual WAN (VWAN) to replace hubs as a managed service.
