    text: 'When our Landing Zone Virtual Networks from different Azure regions need to communicate, we either: - Deploy a partner NVA or Azure Firewall in the Hub, then initiate Global Vnet peering between the hubs. - Interconnect ExpressRoute Gateways and Circuits across regions. In this scenario, both gateways are connected to both circuits, with different weights in the connection resource.'

stem: 'The hub virtual network acts as a central point of connectivity to many spoke virtual networks. The hub can also be used as the connectivity point to your on-premises networks. The spoke virtual networks peer with the hub and can be used to isolate workloads. The benefits of using a hub and spoke configuration include cost savings, overcoming subscription limits, and workload isolation.'
