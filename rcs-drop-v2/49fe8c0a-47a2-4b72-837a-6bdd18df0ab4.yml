    text: Private keys are isolated in hardware and never shared.
    description: 'When you use private/public certificate authentication, the private private key is isolated in hardware (for example, a root of trust such as TPM) and never shared.  Known public keys are shared with IoT services and devices. '

    text: 'For less capable devices, you use IoT "guardian" gateways to enforce strong identity patterns.'
    description: 'For IoT devices that aren''t manufactured with or capable of using strong identity, password-less authentication, or renewable credentials, use IoT gateways to locally interface with these less-capable devices, bridging them to access IoT services with strong identity patterns. '
