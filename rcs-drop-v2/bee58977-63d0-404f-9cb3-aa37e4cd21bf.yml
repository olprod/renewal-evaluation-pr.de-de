Autoscale then monitors the resource requirements of the load and scales the number of nodes up or down.'

    context: 'Serverless SQL pool is a distributed data processing system, built for large-scale data and computational functions and enables you to analyze your Big Data in seconds to minutes, depending on the workload. Thanks to built-in query execution fault-tolerance, the system provides high reliability and success rates even for long-running queries involving large data sets. If you need to explore data in the data lake, gain insights from it or optimize your existing data transformation pipeline, you can benefit from using serverless SQL pool. It is suitable for the following scenarios: Basic discovery and exploration - Quickly reason about the data in various formats (Parquet, CSV, JSON) in your data lake. Logical data warehouse – Provide a relational abstraction on top of raw or disparate data without relocating and transforming data, allowing always up-to-date view of your data. Data transformation - Simple, scalable, and performant way to transform data in the lake using T-SQL, so it can be fed to BI and other tools, or loaded into a relational data store (Synapse SQL databases, Azure SQL Database, etc.).'

In most cases data is partitioned on a date column that is closely tied to the order in which the data is loaded into the SQL pool.One of the greatest benefits of using partitions to maintain data is the avoidance of transaction logging. While simply inserting, updating, or deleting data can be the most straightforward approach, with a little thought and effort, using partitioning during your load process can substantially improve performance. Partitioning can benefit data maintenance and query performance. Whether it benefits both or just one is dependent on how data is loaded and whether the same column can be used for both purposes, since partitioning can only be done on one column.'

Business capabilities are enabled not by data alone, but by BI semantic models that describe concepts, relationships, rules, and standards. This way, they represent intuitive and easy-to-understand structures that define data relationships and encapsulate business rules as calculations. They can also enforce fine-grained data permissions, ensuring the right people have access to the right data. Importantly, they accelerate query performance, providing extremely responsive interactive analytics—even over terabytes of data. Like enterprise models, BI semantic models adopt naming conventions ensuring consistency.'

Dedicated SQL pool supports three methods for distributing data: Round-robin, Hash, and Replicated. A hash distributed table distributes rows based on the value in the distribution column. A hash distributed table is designed to achieve high performance for queries on large tables. A replicated table has a full copy of the table available on every Compute node. Queries run fast on replicated tables because joins on replicated tables don''t require data movement. A round-robin table distributes table rows evenly across all distributions. The rows are distributed randomly. Loading data into a round-robin table is fast. But, queries can require more data movement than the other distribution methods.'
