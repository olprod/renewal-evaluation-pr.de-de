    text: Have proper database design for the expect workload type (transactional vs reporting).
    description: The overall performance and scale of an application is often heavily weighted on the choice and proper implementation of the database. Use normalized data models for transactional processing and consider de-normalizing for reporting workloads.

    text: Use read-only replicas to offload read-only query workloads.
    description: 'Read-only replicas do have some delay in replicating the data, so this does not work if up-to-the-second, real-time reporting is needed.'

    text: Refrain from using higher isolation levels by default unnecessarily.
    description: 'Also consider versioning versus locking. Choosing a proper isolation level is crucial. Too high of an isolation level can impact performance and too low can cause data inconsistencies. Read Committed Snapshot Isolation is the default for Azure SQL Database, only change this if there are good reasons.'
