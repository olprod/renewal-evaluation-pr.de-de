    text: We use active geo-replication.
    description: 'Active Geo-Replication enables you to configure up to 4 readable secondary databases in the same, or different, regions. Secondary databases are available in the case of a service disruption or the inability to connect to the primary database.   Without active geo-replication, if your primary database ever goes offline (planned maintenance, service disruption, hardware failure, etc.) your application database will be offline until you can bring your primary database back online in a healthy state.'
