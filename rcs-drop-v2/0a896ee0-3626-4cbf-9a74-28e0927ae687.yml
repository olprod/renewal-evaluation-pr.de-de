    text: We consider opportunities to reduce the number of containers per group or evaluate Azure Kubernetes Service.
    description: 'Multi-container groups are useful in cases where you want to divide a single functional task into a small number of container images. However, they all share the same resources and have the same lifecycle. The maximum number of containers per container group permitted is 60; However, if any container group is using more than 2 or 3 containers, consider whether there is a good use case for these containers to share resources and lifecycle. Consider identifying opportunities to reduce the number of containers per group or evaluating Azure Kubernetes Service.'

    text: We have a plan or configuration in place to insulate against regional outages affecting Azure Container Instances.
    description: 'Azure Container Instances are deployed to a single Azure Region. If you require high-availability for applications running in ACI, consider employing a multi-region deployment using Azure Front Door or Azure Traffic Manager. This will enable high-availability across multiple regions in the event of a short term outage or longer term disaster. This can also be used to offload SSL.'

    text: 'We store state within the container, either in-memory or on disk, such as session, configuration or logs.'
    description: 'Containers are most resilient when there is no need to store state within the container, or any state is delegated to a separate service such as Azure PaaS services. Ideally, use a service which supports multi-region replication for increased resilience. For example, configuration can be stored in Azure App Configuration, in-memory state such as session can be delegated instead to a distributed cache such as Azure Cache for Redis, and disk-based state can make use of Azure Blob or File Storage.'
