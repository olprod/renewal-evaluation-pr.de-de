    text: We plan a backup and restore process for our API Management instance.
    description: 'Consider taking regular backups of your API Management Service so that it can be easily restored in another region or instance in the same region at any time. Your recovery time objective may require that a standby is always deployed in a secondary region. In this case, it is still good practice to take regular backups to enable the ability to easily recreate your service in the event of an unforeseen loss or misconfiguration of the service as well as to replicate changes between your primary and standby instances.'

    text: We configure multiple Azure regions in our API Management service.
    description: Configuring your API Management Service with multiple regions provides high-availability support in the event that an Azure region experiences downtime or is subject to a disaster scenario. This also reduces API call latency as calls can be routed to the nearest region.

    text: We implement a strategy to ensure availability in the event of an outage or disaster affecting an Azure region.
    description: 'Consider using Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Front Door or Azure DNS to enable access to multiple regional deployments of API Management to ensure you can continue to serve requests in the event of an outage or disaster. This would also require syncing configurations between these individual Standard instances.'
