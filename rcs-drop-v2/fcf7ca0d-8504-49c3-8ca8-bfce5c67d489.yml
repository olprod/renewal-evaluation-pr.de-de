    text: The application was built natively for the cloud.
    description: 'While cloud-native workloads are preferred, migrated or modernized applications are reality and they might not utilize the available cloud functionality like auto-scaling, platform notifications and other features the underlying cloud platform can offer. Understanding if the application is cloud-native or not provides a very useful high level indication about potential technical debt for operability and cost efficiency.'

    text: There is an availability strategy defined and cost implications of it are understood.
    description: 'An availability strategy should capture how the application remains available when in a failure state and should apply across all application components and the application deployment stamp as a whole such as via multi-geo scale-unit deployment approach. There are cost implications as well: More resources need to be provisioned in advance to provide high availability. Active-active setup, while more expensive than single deployment, can balance cost by lowering load on one stamp and reducing the total amount of resources needed.'

    text: This workload benefits from higher density.
    description: 'When running multiple applications (typically in multi-tenant or microservices scenarios) density can be increased by deploying them on shared infrastructure and utilizing it more. For example: Containerization and moving to Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Services) enables pod-based deployment which can utilize underlying nodes efficiently. Similar approach can be taken with App Service Plans. To prevent the ''noisy neighbor'' situation, proper monitoring must be in place and performance analysis must be done (if possible).'

    text: Data is being transferred between regions.
    description: 'Moving data between regions can add additional cost - both on the storage layer and networking layer. It''s worth reviewing if this cost is justified or can be replaced via re-architecture or justified due to e.g. disaster recovery (DR). If applications or services are exchanging data between regions, extra cost is typically accrued.'

    text: Multi-region deployment is supported and cost implications understood.
    description: 'Multiple regions should be used for fail-over purposes in a disaster state, as part of either re-deployment, warm-spare active-passive, or hot-spare active-active strategies. Additional cost needs to be taken into consideration - mostly from compute, data and networking perspective, but also services like Azure Site Recovery (ASR).'

    text: The workload is designed to use Availability Zones within a region.
    description: 'Availability Zones can be used to optimise application availability within a region by providing data-center level fault tolerance. However, the application architecture must not share dependencies between zones to use them effectively. It is also important to note that Availability Zones may introduce performance and cost considerations for applications which are extremely ''chatty'' across zones given the implied physical separation between each zone and inter-zone bandwidth charges. That also means that AZ can be considered to get higher SLA for lower cost. Be aware of pricing changes coming to Availability Zone bandwidth starting February 2021.'
