    description: 'When the number of downstream devices, their messages, and message size is static, and the devices use MQTT or AMQP to connect to the gateway/IoT Edge, a single gateway/IoT Edge device in transparent mode can connect the downstream devices and forward the messages. The gateway/IoT Edge device takes care of bidirectional communication and message buffering.'

    description: 'When the number of downstream devices, their messages and message size is static, and the protocol or message needs translation, a single gateway/IoT Edge device in translation mode can connect the downstream devices and forward the messages. Account for bidirectional translation and message translation and message buffering overhead.'

      With the capability to have multiple gateways/IoT Edge devices per site and downstream devices that can connect to any of those gateways/IoT Edge devices, the solution is horizontally scalable. Gateways/IoT Edge devices in translation mode can translate protocols or message to and from downstream devices. However, a mapping is needed to find the gateway a downstream device is connected to. Account for additional message translation and buffering overhead at the gateway/IoT Edge device.
