Start by collecting model data from deployed models: Monitor new data for differences between any baseline and target dataset, Profile features in data to track how statistical properties change over time, Set up alerts on data drift for early warnings to potential issues, Create a new dataset version when you determine the data has drifted too much. An Azure Machine Learning dataset is used to create the monitor. The dataset must include a timestamp column. You can view data drift metrics with the Python SDK or in Azure Machine Learning studio. Other metrics and insights are available through the Azure Application Insights resource associated with the Azure Machine Learning workspace.'
