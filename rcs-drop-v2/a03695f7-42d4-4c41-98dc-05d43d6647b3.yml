  Asynchronous messaging and event-driven communication are critical assets when building a distributed application that's composed of several internal and external services. When you design a multitenant solution, it's crucial to conduct a preliminary analysis to define how to share or partition messages that pertain to different tenants.


  Sharing the same messaging system or event-streaming service can significantly reduce the operational cost and management complexity. However, using a dedicated messaging system for each tenant provides better data isolation, reduces the risk of data leakage, eliminates the Noisy Neighbor issue, and allows to charge back Azure costs to tenants easily.
