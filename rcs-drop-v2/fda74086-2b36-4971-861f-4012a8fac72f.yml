    text: You have considered non-recurring engineering costs such as manufacturing and testing.
    description: 'Pre-certified system components or modules can reduce time-to-market to create a semi-custom device, but these components are also more expensive than discrete chips. Supply-chain and inventory management need to be properly resourced.'

    text: 'You have clearly quantified the deployment cost, including staging, shipment and installation (including personnel training), of the device, and developed process to reduce those costs.'
    description: 'Typically, using a pre-existing infrastructure, both for networking and for power supply, minimizes the cost of the installation. On the other hand, this approach might require a guarantee that they will not impact the existing system. In any case, the installation of the IoT devices demands dedicated resources (internal or external) that need to be trained.'
