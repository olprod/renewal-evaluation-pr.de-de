    text: Devices use Device Provisioning Service to get and cache the initial connection to IoT Hub and use the cached value when they restart.
    description: 'Devices use Device Provisioning Service (DPS) to get the initial connection to the IoT Hub when they restart but then cache this value to use in future restarts. When the cached connection becomes invalid, a device can request a new connection through DPS and cache the new value. This limits the number of provisioning requests to DPS when many devices restart at the same time.'
