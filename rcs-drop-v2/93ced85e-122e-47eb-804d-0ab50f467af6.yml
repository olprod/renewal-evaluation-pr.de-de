    text: Budgets are assigned to all services in this workload.
    description: 'For cost management it is recommended to have a budget even for the smallest services operated, because that allows to track and understand the flow of the spend and also understand the impact of a smaller service in a bigger picture.'

    text: There is a cost owner for every service used by this workload.
    description: Every service should have a cost owner that is tracking and is responsible for cost. This drives responsibility and awareness on who owns the cost tracking.

    text: Cost forecasting is done to ensure it aligns with the budget.
    description: In order to predict costs and trends it’s recommended to use forecasting to be proactive for any spending that might be going up due to higher demand than anticipated.

    text: There is a monthly or yearly meeting where the budget is reviewed.
    description: 'As Azure changes and new services are introduced, it is recommended that key services are revisited to see if any new services offered in Azure can help drive down cost or if new SKUs can help drive down cost. It’s recommended that this is done 1-4 times a year. Revisit key Azure services to see if there were any updates which could reduce spending.'

    text: Every environment has a plan for migrating to PaaS or serverless to lower the all up cost and transfer risk.
    description: 'To bring down cost the goal should be to get as many applications to only consume resources when they are used, this goes as an evolution from IaaS to PaaS to serverless where you only pay when a service is triggered. The PaaS and serverless might appear more expensive, but risk and other operational work is transferred to the cloud provider which should also be factored in as part of the cost (e.g. patching, monitoring, licenses).'

    text: There is a clear understanding of how budget is defined.
    description: 'It is important to have a clear understanding how an IT budget is defined. This is especially true for applications that are not built in-house, where IT budget has to be factored in as part of the delivery.'

    text: Budget is factored into the building phase.
    description: When building new applications it’s a good practice to have a discussion with the business regarding expectations and build a budget as early as possible and document assumptions of how the IT budget for the service was calculated.

    text: There is an ongoing conversation between the app owner and the business.
    description: Is what is delivered from IT and what the business is expecting from IT mapped to the cost of the application? Communication between the app owner and business should be constant in order to ensure a management of expectations and cost.

    text: There is a plan to modernize the workload.
    description: 'Is there a plan to change the execution model to Serverless? The reasoning for this is to move as far as you can up the stack towards cloud-native. When the workload is serverless, it’s charged only for actual use, whereas with traditional infrastructure there are many underlying things that need to be factored into the price. By applying an end date to the application it encourages you to discuss the goal of re-designing the application to make even better use of the cloud. It might be more expensive from an Azure cost point of view but factoring in other things like licenses, people, time to deploy can drive down cost.'

    text: Azure Tags are used to enrich Azure resources with operational metadata.
    description: 'Azure Tags provide the ability to associate critical meta-data as a name-value pair, such as billing information (e.g. cost center code), environment information (e.g. environment type), with Azure resources, resource groups, and subscriptions. See Tagging Strategies for best practices. Using tags can help manage resources and make it easier to find relevant items during operational procedures.'

    text: The application has a well-defined naming standard for Azure resources.
    description: A well-defined naming convention is important for overall operations to be able to easily determine the usage of certain resources and help understand owners and cost centers responsible for the workload. Naming conventions allow the matching of resource costs to particular workloads.

    text: Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is used to control access to operational and financial dashboards and underlying data.
    description: 'Are the dashboards openly available in your organization or do you limit access based on roles etc.? For example: developers usually don''t need to know the overall cost of Azure for the company, but it might be good for them to be able to watch a particular workload. Access to operational and financial data should be tightly controlled to align with segregation of duties, while making sure that it doesn''t hinder operational effectiveness; i.e. scenarios where developers have to raise an ticket to access logs should be avoided.'
