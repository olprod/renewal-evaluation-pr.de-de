  Power Platform’s low code approach to solution delivery has enabled thousands of organizations around the world to use technology to transform their business. It does this by enabling more people than ever before to create applications, integrate into their larger enterprise and to leverage mobile platforms and artificial technology to transform organizations with new ways of working.

  This transformation is more critical now than ever. Technology is disrupting every industry but is also the key to those that are thriving. The events of the past year have shown that traditional IT risk planning approaches are no match for the benefits of the agility provided by digital transformation. Hence, it’s important to start the digital transformation journey incrementally, but with urgency.

  This assessment will help identify the maturity of your Citizen Developer Journey and to prioritize actions for the areas of improvement which we can use to support your adoption program.
