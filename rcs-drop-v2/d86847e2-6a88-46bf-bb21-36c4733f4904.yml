stem: 'An ever-increasing number of multitenant solutions are built around artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). A multitenant AI/ML solution is one that provides similar ML-based capabilities to any number of tenants. Tenants generally can''t see or share the data of any other tenant, but in some situations, tenants might use the same models as other tenants.'
