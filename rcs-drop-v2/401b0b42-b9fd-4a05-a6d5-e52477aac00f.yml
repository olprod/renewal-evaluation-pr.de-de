    text: Define rules for your data lifecycle.
    description: 'Lifecycle management policies periodically move data between tiers. Policies can move data based on rules that specified by the user. For example, you might create rules that move blobs to the archive tier if that blob has not been modified in 90 days. Unused data can be completely removed using a policy. By creating policies that adjust the access tier of your data, you can design the least expensive storage options for your need.'
