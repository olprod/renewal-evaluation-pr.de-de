    context: 'Distributed applications typically implement either or both of the following strategies when caching data: Using a private cache, where data is held locally on the computer that''s running an instance of an application or service; Using a shared cache, serving as a common source that can be accessed by multiple processes and machines. In both cases, caching can be performed client-side and server-side. Client-side caching is done by the process that provides the user interface for a system, such as a web browser or desktop application. Server-side caching is done by the process that provides the business services that are running remotely.'
