    text: Consider using local compute or remote managed compute for automated machine learning to reduce costs.
    description: |
      Start by developing and experimenting on a small amount of data and use your local environment, such as a local computer or a cloud-based virtual machine (VM) as your compute target.  As you scale up to larger data or do distributed training, start using training compute targets such as an Azure Machine Learning compute cluster or instance or other specialized options. After your model is ready, deploy it to a web hosting environment with a deployment compute targets.
