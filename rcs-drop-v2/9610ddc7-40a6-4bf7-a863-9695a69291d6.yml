      Operations are always complex. If you limit the scope of operations to one workload or a small collection of workloads, complexity can be controlled. As such, decentralized operations are the least complex of the common operating models. In this form of operations, all workloads are operated independently by dedicated workload teams.

    text: Centralized operations - Central operations tend to be the norm for technology environments that consist primarily of stable-state workloads. Examples of a stable-state of operations include things like commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications or well-established custom applications that have a slow-release cadence.

Examples of a stable-state of operations include things like commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) applications or well-established custom applications that have a slow-release cadence. When rate of change is driven by regular updates and patches, centralization of operations is an effective means to manage the portfolio.

For others, global operations and various compliance requirements might prevent specific business units from making a change. A distributing operations approach might be required for those companies.
