    text: Refrain from using higher isolation levels by default unnecessarily - also consider versioning vs locking.
    description: "Choosing a proper isolation level is crucial, too high of an isolation level can impact performance, too low can cause data inconsistencies.Read Committed Snapshot Isolation is the default for Azure SQL Database, only change this if there are good reasons.\_"
