    text: You don't use the Azure IoT device SDKs. You've implemented your own policies to handle transient connectivity issues.
    description: 'You can develop device or backend apps without using the Azure IoT SDKs. However Microsoft strongly advises using an Azure IoT SDK. The Azure IoT device and service SDKs are published on many popular platforms. The SDKs provide a convenient layer that handles much of the complexity of the underlying communication protocol, including device connection and reconnection, and retry policy.'
