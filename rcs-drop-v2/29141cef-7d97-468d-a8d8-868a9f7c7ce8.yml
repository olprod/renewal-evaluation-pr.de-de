    text: Performance tests are performed regularly.
    description: 'Regular testing should be performed as part of each major change and if possible on a regular basis to validate existing thresholds, targets and assumptions, as well as ensuring the validity of the health model, capacity model and operational procedures.'

    text: You have identified the human and environmental resources needed to create performance tests.
    description: 'Successfully implementing meaningful performance tests requires a number of resources. If is not just a single developer or QA Analyst running some tests on their local machine. Instead, performance tests need a test environment (also known as a test bed) that tests can be executed against without interfering with production environments and data.'

    text: You are using appropriate tools to conduct performance tests on your workload.
    description: ' Some tools like JMeter only perform testing against endpoints and tests HTTP statuses. Other tools like K6 and Selenium can perform tests that also check data quality and variations. Application Insights, while not necessarily designed to test server load, can test the performance of an application within the user''s browser.'

    text: The testing plan includes occasionally injecting faults.
    description: 'Chaos engineering is a common practice to verify the effectiveness of operational procedures using artificial faults. For example, taking dependencies offline (stopping API apps, shutting down VMs, etc.), restricting access (enabling firewall rules, changing connection strings, etc.) or forcing failover (database level, Front Door, etc.) is a good way to validate that the application is able to handle faults gracefully.'
