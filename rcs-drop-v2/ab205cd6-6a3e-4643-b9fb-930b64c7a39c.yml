Data privacy relies on access control policies implemented by the cloud and trusted by the customer. Homomorphic encryption allows computations on encrypted data without requiring access to a secret (decryption) key. The results of the computations are encrypted and can be revealed only by the owner of the secret key. Using homomorphic encryption, cloud operators will never have unencrypted access to the data they are storing and computing on. Computations are performed directly on encrypted data. Data privacy relies on state-of-the-art cryptography, and the data owner controls all information releases.'

Examples include hiring, school admissions, and lending where a model might be much better at picking good candidates among a specific group of people than among other groups, Harm of quality-of-service: An AI system doesn’t work as well for one group of people as it does for another. As an example, a voice recognition system might fail to work as well for women as it does for men.'
