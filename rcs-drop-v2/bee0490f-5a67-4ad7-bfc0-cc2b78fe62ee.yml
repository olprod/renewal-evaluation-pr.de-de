    text: You use Device Provisioning Service (DPS) with multiple regional IoT hubs linked to DPS and have enabled appropriate allocation policy
    description: 'The Device Provisioning Service (DPS) can only provision devices to IoT hubs that have been linked to it. Linking an IoT hub to a DPS instance gives the service read/write permissions to the IoT hub''s device registry. With the link, DPS can register a device ID and set the initial configuration in the device twin. Linked IoT hubs may be in any Azure region. You may link hubs in other subscriptions to your provisioning service.'
