    text: All messages have equal importance.
    description: 'All messages are sent in order. When you use IoT Edge, messages are buffered when there''s no connection, but after the connection is restored, all buffered messages are sent in order followed by new messages.'

    text: Messages have different priorities.
    description: 'For example send alarms with the highest priority and telemetry with lower priority, so that the alarm messages are always sent first to the cloud. When you use IoT Edge, you can use priority queues to separate messages based on priority. IoT Edge buffers messages when there''s no connection. When the connection is restored, IoT Edge sends all buffered messages by priority (highest priority first) followed by newly arrived messages.'

    text: 'You have multiple ingestion strategies for different messages, priorities, data types, volumes and latency.'
    description: 'Use different strategies for ingesting different types of data. For example, send real-time messages to IoT Hub directly, and use IoT Hub file upload or batch data transfer (such as Data Factory) if the data isn''t needed in real time.'
