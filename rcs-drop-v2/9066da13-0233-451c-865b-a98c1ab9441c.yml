    text: Tested and validated defined latency and defined throughput targets per scenario and component.
    description: 'Throughput targets, which are commonly defined in terms of IOPs, MB/s and Block Size, should be defined and measured for key application scenarios, as well as each individual components, to validate overall application performance and health. Available throughput for storage varies based on the VM Size/SKU, so defined targets should be used to inform the use of appropriate VM SKUs and number of data disks per VM to aggregate total IOPs if required.'
