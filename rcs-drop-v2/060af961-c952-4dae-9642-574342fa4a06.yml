    text: Removed all single points of failure by running multiple instances of the application components.
    description: Have all single points of failure been eliminated? A single point of failure describes a specific fault-point which if it where to fail would bring down the entire application. Single points of failure introduce significant risk since any failure of this component will cause an application outage.
