When multiple files exist in a filegroup, data is spread across files using the proportional fill algorithm. The data is partitioned horizontally, so that groups of rows are mapped into individual partitions. All partitions of a single index or table must reside in the same database. After partitioning a table or index, queries that use partition elimination can have comparable or improved performance with larger number of partitions. Queries that do not use partition elimination could take longer to execute as the number of partitions increases.'
