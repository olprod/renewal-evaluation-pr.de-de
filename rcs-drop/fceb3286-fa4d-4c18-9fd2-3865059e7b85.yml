### YamlMime:QuestionSet
scenario: |-
  You are creating a customer feedback survey in Dynamics 365 Customer Voice that will be sent with Microsoft Power Automate when a contact center agent closes a case for a customer.

  The survey includes the question “How would you rate your experience with customer support about {{CaseTitle}}, case number {{CaseNumber}}?” You are expecting the two variables to be replaced with the case title and the case number, respectively.

  When testing the survey, the variables show up as {{CaseNumber}} and {{CaseTitle}}, rather than the actual values from the case that was closed.

  You need to identify the problem so you can update the configuration correctly.

  What is the problem?
