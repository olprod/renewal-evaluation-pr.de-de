### YamlMime:QuestionSet
scenario: |-
  You have an IoT Edge solution that contains a simulated temperature sensor module named tempSensor1 and a custom module named customModule1.

  tempSensor1 sends messages to customModule1.

  customModule1 processes messages from tempSensor1 and sends the processed messages to the IoT Edge Hub.

  You are adding dedicated storage on the IoT Edge device to store and retrieve messages from Modules when working offline.

  You need to configure the Deployment Manifest to link the Module Storage to Device Storage and define the mapping between the Module Storage Path and the Host Storage Path.

  Which two modules should you configure? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.
