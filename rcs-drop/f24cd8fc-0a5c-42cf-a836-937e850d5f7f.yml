  You are configuring Dynamics 365 for a company that franchises hair salons and tanning salons. Omnichannel for Customer Service is deployed.

  The hair salons and tanning salons have many locations.

  You deploy a self-service portal so that customers can look up issues surrounding tanning, tanning beds, and tanning bed options.

  For issues where no information is available on the self-service portal, customers must contact the call center. When they call in, their interactions on the self-service portal must be made available to the customer service agents who take their call.
