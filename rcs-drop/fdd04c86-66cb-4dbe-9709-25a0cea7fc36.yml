  You create a rule to open a case in the executive queue when emails arrive for the company’s CEO. You activate the rule and verify that the rule works.

  You then create a second rule to open a case in the same queue when emails arrive for the company’s vice president. You activate the rule and verify that the rule works.

  When you evaluate both rules together, the first rule no longer works.

  You need to identify the issue.
